--- abstract

This draft follows the invitation of {{draft-farrell-ufmrg-sample}} to propose
another sample problem for demonstration, training, and evaluation of formal
methods in IETF work.  It draws on recent work from the {{suit}} and {{teep}}
working groups to define a sample modeling problem for a novel rather than a
familiar IETF protocol.
