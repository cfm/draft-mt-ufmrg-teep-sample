            A Usable Formal Methods Sample Problem from TEEP
                   draft-mt-ufmrg-teep-sample-latest

Abstract

   This draft follows the invitation of [draft-farrell-ufmrg-sample] to
   propose another sample problem for demonstration, training, and
   evaluation of formal methods in IETF work.  It draws on recent work
   from the Software Updates for the Internet of Things [suit] and
   Trusted Execution Environment Provisioning [teep] working groups to
   define a sample modeling problem for a novel rather than a familiar
   IETF protocol.

1.  Introduction

   In this draft we take the Trusted Execution Environment Provisioning
   protocol [teep-protocol] to be a good domain from which to draw a
   sample modeling problem for slightly different reasons than those
   proposed in [draft-farrell-ufmrg-sample].

   1.  TEEP is a proposed standard under active development, at working-
       group consensus as of this writing.  Formal modeling, even for
       demonstration or training purposes, can therefore increase
       familiarity with the TEEP protocol, including outside of the SUIT
       and TEEP working groups directly involed in its development.

   2.  The TEEP protocol is expressly concerned with security, so it has
       security properties amenable to formal description, modeling, and
       analysis.  Any findings may have valuble security implications.

   3.  The TEEP protocol has well-defined use cases and includes
       provisions for constrained environments.  Modeling the entire
       protocol is a reasonble learning or training exercise, whereas
       [draft-farrell-ufmrg-sample] limits itself to just the SEARCH
       command of [RFC9051].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  The Trusted Execution Environment Provisioning (TEEP) Protocol

   The Trusted Execution Environment Provisioning protocol
   [teep-protocol] specifies communication between a Trusted Application
   Manager [RFC9397] (Section 2) and a TEEP agent.  Importantly, this
   communication is relayed by an _untrusted_ TEEP Broker [RFC9397]
   (Section 6.1).

   # TAM -> TEEP Agent: QueryRequest
   {token, challenge, supported-teep-cipher-suites,
   supported-suit-cose-profiles, data-item-requested(trusted-components,
   attestation)}SK_TAM

   # TAM -> Attester: Get Evidence (Challenge)
   Challenge

   # TAM <- Attester: Evidence(Challenge)
   {Challenge, Claims}SK_Attester

   # TAM <- TEEP Agent: QueryResponse
   {token, selected-teep-cipher-suite, attestation-payload-format(EAT),
   attestation-payload({Challenge, Claims}SK_Attester),tc-list,
   requested-tc-list, requested-tc-list}SK_AGENT


   # Author -> TAM: Software
   {manifest, sequence_nr, software}SK_AUTHOR

   # TAM -> TEEP Agent: Update
   {token', {manifest, sequence_nr, software}SK_AUTHOR}SK_TAM

   # TAM <- TEEP Agent: Success
   {token'}SK_AGENT
